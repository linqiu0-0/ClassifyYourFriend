                            We train a classifier that is able to classify cat and dog breed. The classifier will be trained on a large dataset of cat and dog images and will be able to identify the specific breed of a cat or dog image with high accuracy.

                            To improve the accuracy of our classification, this project will be split into to parts. First, we will train a binary classification model [model_1] that can classify cats and dogs separately. Second, we will develop two models to classify cat breeds and dog breeds separately. Userâ€™s input photo will be first processed in the model_1 and it will go to the dog breed model or cat breed model depends on result from model_1. By doing so, we can reduce the complexity of the problem and increase the accuracy of the model.

                            We might use various machine learning classification methods, including logistic regression,  k-nearest neighbors, CNN and etc. After trying different algorithms, we can evaluate their performance and select the best one for our problem. We can then fine-tune the model to improve its accuracy and optimize its hyperparameters.
