    "problem_description":"A survey conducted by the American Pet Products Association (APPA) in 2021-2022 found that 70% of households own a pet. Among the 70%, there are 69 million U.S. households that own a dog compared to 45.3 million households that own a cat. People are constantly sharing pictures and video recordings of their pets through social media, but to other people, they may not know the breed of the pet they see. Therefore, we want to build a website that allows people to upload the pictures of the dog/cats and provide a classification result based on the training data."
